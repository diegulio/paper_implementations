# Paper Implementations

In this repo I will publish different papers implementations made by me. You will be able to see the process (in spanish) in my [blog](http://diegulio.github.io)

Current Papers implemented:

- [**Generative Adversarial Networks**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661)
- **[Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434)**

# How to run

Every paper folder will have their own poetry env, so you should:

## **Installation**

### **Clone Repository**

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/diegulio/paper_implementations
```

### **Poetry Environment Setup**

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. If you don't have Poetry installed, you can install it following the instructions on their website.

After cloning the repository, navigate to the project's root directory and run:

```bash
poetry install
```

This will create a virtual environment and install all the necessary dependencies.

## **Usage**

Explain how to run and use the project. Include any configuration steps or command-line arguments that may be required.

```bash
cd paper/
poetry run python train.py
```
